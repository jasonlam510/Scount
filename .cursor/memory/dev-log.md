# Development Log (Cross-Feature Decisions)

Purpose: capture **important clarifications and philosophy/design decisions** that:

- came from user convention/clarification during development
- are **not** requirements for a single feature
- should guide future features and prevent re-litigating decisions

Not for:

- feature-specific decisions (use `.cursor/scopes/<feature>/log.md` or `memory.md`)
- raw meeting notes or long transcripts

## Format

Use one entry per decision, newest first.

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — [Area] Short title

- **Context**: what prompted this (1–2 sentences)
- **Decision**: the rule / philosophy (MUST/SHOULD)
- **Rationale**: why
- **Implications**: what future features should do differently
- **Links**: scope docs / PRs / files (paths)
